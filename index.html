            <p class="p1">  I believe web development is one of the most powerful tools a person can learn nowadays, both in terms of career development and in terms of building long lasting positive impact in the world.
            <p class="p2"> I have extensive experience in Digital Marketing and since the past 3 years I have began to learn coding on my own and since then I was interested in a career change. I did coding introduction courses in the beginning of my coding journey and I am currently doing the Free Code Camp certificate (www.freecodecamp.org) and a coding challenge called "100 days of code", in which I have to code for at least 1 hour per day.</p>
            <p class="p3">My stack includes HMTL, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby, and now I would like to grow my knowledge on Front End and Back End Development to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  </p>
